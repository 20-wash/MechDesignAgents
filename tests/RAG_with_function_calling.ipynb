      "2. **Define dimensions:** Set the dimensions for the plate and the hole.\n",
      "3. **Create the plate:** Use `Workplane(\"XY\").box()` to create a rectangular plate with the specified dimensions.\n",
      "4. **Create the hole:** Use `Workplane(\"XY\").circle().extrude()` to create a cylindrical hole with the specified diameter and extrude it to the thickness of the plate.\n",
      "5. **Cut the hole:** Use the `cut()` method to subtract the hole geometry from the plate geometry.\n",
      "6. **Visualize the model:** Use `show()` from `ocp_vscode` to visualize the resulting plate with the hole.\n",
      "7. **Export the model:** Use `cq.exporters.export()` to save the model in STL, DXF, and STEP file formats. \n",
      "\n",
      "This code will generate a plate with a hole in the center. You can adjust the dimensions and position of the hole as needed. \n",

      "The output you are seeing suggests that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **OCP_vscode is trying to connect:** The message \"Using port 3939 taken from config file\" indicates that the `ocp_vscode` library is attempting to connect to a viewer (likely a Jupyter kernel) using port 3939. This is expected behavior as it's how the visualization works.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **No active Jupyter kernel:** The message \"Jupyter kernel not running\" means that `ocp_vscode` couldn't find an active Jupyter kernel to display the CAD model. This is likely the reason you don't see the visualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The \"+\" symbol:** This usually indicates that the program is waiting for further input or actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's how to fix this:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Make sure you are running the code in a Jupyter environment:** The `ocp_vscode` library relies on a Jupyter kernel to display the CAD model. Ensure you are running your Python script within a Jupyter Notebook or Lab environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Start a Jupyter kernel:** If you are in a Jupyter environment but haven't started a kernel yet, you need to create a new notebook and run a cell to initiate the kernel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for conflicting processes:** If a Jupyter kernel is already running, there might be conflicts. Try restarting the kernel or your Jupyter environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Verify port configuration:** Ensure that the port specified in your `ocp_vscode` configuration (likely port 3939) is not being used by any other process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have a running Jupyter kernel and no port conflicts, the `show()` function from `ocp_vscode` should be able to connect and display your CAD model correctly. \n",

      "**1. Verify Jupyter Installation:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**2. Running Code in the Correct Environment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Use a Jupyter Notebook or Lab:**  Make sure you are running the provided Python code within a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) or Jupyter Lab environment. These environments provide the necessary framework for `ocp_vscode` to function.\n",
      "   - **Don't run directly in the terminal:** Avoid running the code directly in the terminal using `python your_script.py`. This won't provide the Jupyter environment needed for visualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Restart Kernel and Jupyter:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Restart the kernel:** Within your Jupyter Notebook or Lab, go to the \"Kernel\" menu and select \"Restart Kernel\". \n",
      "   - **Restart Jupyter:** If restarting the kernel doesn't work, try restarting the entire Jupyter Notebook server or Jupyter Lab.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Check for Conflicting Processes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Identify processes using port 3939:** Open your system monitor or task manager and look for any processes that might be using port 3939. Terminate these processes if they are not essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Consider Alternatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Use a different visualization library:** If the issue persists, consider using a different CAD visualization library that doesn't rely on a Jupyter kernel, such as `pythreejs` or `vtk`.\n",
