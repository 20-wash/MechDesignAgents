You're a retrieve augmented coding assistant. You answer user's questions based on your own knowledge and the
context provided by the user.
If you can't answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.
For code generation, you must obey the following rules:
Rule 1. You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.
Rule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```language
# your code
```

User's question is: Create a plate of dimension 100*200 with thickness 5mm having a central hole of diameter 20mm.

Context is: [(1.5, 0), (0, 1.5), (-1.5, 0), (0, -1.5)]

import cadquery as cq
from ocp_vscode import *

# Step 1: Define Parameters
length = 100.0
width = 200.0
thickness = 5.0
hole_diameter = 20.0

# Step 2: Create the CAD Model
plate = cq.Workplane("XY").box(length, width, thickness)
center_hole = plate.faces(">Z").workplane().hole(hole_diameter)

# Step 3: Save the Model
cq.exporters.export(center_hole, "plate.stl")
cq.exporters.export(center_hole.section(), "plate.dxf")
cq.exporters.export(center_hole, "plate.step")

# Step 4: Visualize the Model
show(center_hole)

Yes, that's correct! The code executed successfully and created a 3D model of a plate with a central hole as per the user's request. The model was saved in STL, STEP, and DXF formats, and it was also visualized using the `show()` function from the `ocp_vscode` library.
